# Course 1:
In this course I learned about basic operators like ```<-``` to store something in a variable like a simple +, -, /, x and ^ calculation. It also showed me how to get help like ```?c()``` to find out more about vectors. Furthermore the course teached me about vectors and how to create them with the ```c()``` command. A vector can also be stored in a variable either alone or together with a calculation, another variable or even another vector. The course closed with explaining how R calculated especially about the variable or vector length and how it recycles them if caclulations are doen with variables or vectors in different length. 

# Course 2:
In this course I learned about my my workspace and files. The idea was to navigate threw my explorer with the console. The command ```getwd()```returns the path of the current working directory and the command ```setwd()``` allows me to change the working directory to another path. ```ls()``` lists all objects I have stored and ```list.files()``` returns a list of all files including directories of my working directory. The ```args()``` command allows me to view a functions arugments that can be used. Several more commands were introduced to create, manipulate and copy files. 

```create.dir()
file.info()
file.path()
file.rename()
create.file()
file.exists()
```
And in some extend about how to combine commands in one.

# Course 3

The course about sequences of numbers introduced the operator ```":"``` and ```seq()``` as well as ```rep()```.
With ```1:10``` all numbers from 1 to 10 are returned. The works with ```seq(1, 10)```. The function ```rep()``` allowes me to repeat sequences. Various examples with different approaches to the same problem were introduced.

Additional usefull parameters were ```length=,times=,èach=```










This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
